If you want to keep your strawberry cake longer than five days, you can freeze it. We recommend freezing the individual, unfrosted layers. Just wrap the (completely cooled) layers tightly in storage wrap. Follow that with a layer of aluminum foil labeled with the date. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight.
""Great recipe,"" raves ejkelsey. ""I added a simple strawberry glaze to the still warm layers before chilling. Then I used a strawberry buttercream on top.""
""I whipped the egg whites separately and folded them in at the end,"" says ShamikaC. ""I also used fresh strawberries for the purée. Cake came out delicious and moist.""
